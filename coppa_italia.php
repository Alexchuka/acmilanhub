			<p>M'Baye Niang and Carlos Bacca took Milan to the Coppa Quarter-Finals, as Ervin Zukanovic saw red for Sampdoria.<br>
					The Coppa Italia tie was billed as crucial for the future of Coach Sinisa Mihajlovic, with President Silvio<br>
					Berlusconi unhappy with the team’s performances so far.</p><br>
					
				<p>The Serbian opted for a 4-4-2 system, with Giacomo Bonaventura supporting Bacca and Niang.<br>
					It was the home side who had the first real chance of the game, with four minutes on the clock.<br>
					The Blucerchiati broke quickly, and Roberto Soriano might have slipped the ball right to Luis Muriel.<br>
					Instead the Italian international took the ball on himself, and was brought down right on the edge of the<br>
					box by Andrea Bertolacci. From the resulting free-kick, Ervin Zukanovic hit the wall.<br>
					Carlos Bacca had the ball in the net with just over a quarter of an hour gone, but it was correctly ruled-out for offside.</p><br>
					
				<p>	M’Baye Niang almost broke the deadlock with a stunning effort on 24 minutes. The Frenchman’s chest-and-volley attempt <br>
					flashed just wide of the far post. Milan were putting the pressure on, but were served a warning on 32 minutes. Zukanovic<br>
					headed the ball down from a corner, but no-one in a blue shirt could get on the end of it.</p><br>

				<p>	Luis Muriel almost opened the scoring just before half-time, but Christian Abbiati got down well to parry the Colombian’s<br/>
					left-footed shot from the edge of the area. The veteran goalkeeper had to be alert again moments later, denying Carlos Carbonero.</p><br>

				<p>	Niang gave the visitors the lead five minutes into the second half. Bacca slid a perfect pass through the Samp defence, and the<br/>
					Frenchman fired it low into the far corner. Philippe Mexes almost let the Blucerchiati back into it just moments later, but Luis Muriel<br/>
					couldn’t capitalise after the Frenchman played the ball off him and allowed him through on goal.</p><br>

				<p>	Zukanovic then made the task harder for his team, by picking up two yellow cards in a matter of seconds. The Bosnian fouled Juraj Kucka,<br/>
					earning him a caution, then said the wrong thing to referee Domenico Celi, who sent him for an early bath</p><br>

					Carlos Bacca almost made it 2-0, but he couldn't quite get on the end of M'Baye Niang's cross.

				<p>As the match headed into injury time, Antonio Cassano's right-footed shot flashed just wide of Abbiati's far post.<br>
					However, Bacca put the result beyond doubt in the final minute. Keisuke Honda found the striker in the box, and he cut inside before<br/>
					finding the corner with a low strike. The result offers Mihajlovic the opportunity to relieve some of the pressure, with the Diavolo <br/>
					now having a real chance of making the final.</p><br>

				<p>	we will face Carpi in the Quarter-Finals, and then the winner of the tie between Spezia and Alessandria.</p><br>
